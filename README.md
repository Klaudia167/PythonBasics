# Deep Learning Classes
This repository is a part of the Python-Basics course. The course is oriented on teaching these parts of Python that are useful in the next Machine-Learning courses. Namely, we are focused on the basics and the Pandas library.

This is an ongoing process; the first version of this repo should be ready by January 2021


**This repository is only a part of the course, prepared for sharing it with my students. Feel free to use it as you wish, but without the rest of the course it may not be useful for you.**
